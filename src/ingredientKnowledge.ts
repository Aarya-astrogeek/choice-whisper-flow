  "artificial flavors":
    "Artificial flavors improve consistency across batches. Long-term health impact varies and depends on individual sensitivity.",
  "preservatives":
    "Preservatives extend shelf life. Some people prefer fresher alternatives, but approved ones are generally safe in limits.",
